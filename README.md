# Bank & ATM Console App in C++  -- **by Akshit Tyagi**

This is a console-based banking system I developed in C++ to strengthen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming**, **file handling**, and **menu-driven CLI applications**. It simulates basic banking functionalities like creating accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries â€” all handled using file-based persistence (no external database).

This project was a hands-on exercise to translate theoretical C++ concepts into a practical, real-world application.

# What I Learned
- Implementing **OOP principles** like encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity
- Handling persistent data storage using `fstream`
- Designing a **menu-driven** CLI interface
- Writing clean, maintainable, and modular C++ code

---

# Features
- Create new bank accounts
- Deposit or withdraw funds
- Check account balance
- Search customers by account number
- View all account details
- File-based data storage (persistent without database)

---

# Concepts Used
- C++ Classes and Objects
- File I/O using `fstream`
- Modular structure with header and source files
- Input validation and control in terminal
- Clear code separation and reuse

# How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`)
2. Compile the code:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o BankApp
./BankApp
