#  Bank & ATM Console App in C++ — by Akshit Tyagi

This is a simple console-based C++ project I built to understand object-oriented programming, file handling, and menu-driven CLI design. The app simulates core banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiry — all with persistent file storage, without using a database.

This project helped me practice:
- OOP concepts like encapsulation and class-based architecture
- File handling using fstream for storing account data
- Building a user-friendly terminal-based interface

# Features

- Create new bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Check balance
- View all customer details
- Search by account number
- File-based data persistence (no database required)



# Concepts Used

- C++ (OOP, Classes, Functions)
- File Handling with `fstream`
- CLI Menus and input control
- Header and source file modularity
